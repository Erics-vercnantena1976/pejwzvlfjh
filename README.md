OMG I just got outta The Electric State and my head's spinning like a carousel on acid?? The theater was a madhouse, people shuffling and crunching popcorn like some weird dystopian chorus. I swear my back needs a retirement plan after sitting in those seats… but anyway, that  ? Whoa.

> Like, first off, those visuals hit you like a drunk kaleidoscope at a 3am houseparty. There's this scene, you know, where the girl, uh, Michelle? or was it Mikey? is wandering through those desolate townscapes and it felt like my brain was having a staring contest with a Salvador Dali painting. And the robots? Like mechanical flamingos that walked like they were pondering life's existential questions... why does every robot need to look like it's having a mid-life crisis? 

I remember someone saying 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   but seriously, you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in a dark theater to feel it suffocating your senses. Like, when the giant, um, shrimp-looking machine — not sure if it was actually shrimp-like but it just popped in my head — loomed over everything, my popcorn popped again, mid-air. 

I think there was this bit where the sky looked like a faded piece of denim, and for a second, I felt like diving in, but then the denim turned into like... electrically-charged cotton candy?? But that's when my brain glitched - couldn't tell if it was my imagination or just too much sugar from the Dana (Dayna?) in its like futuristic quest or whatever. Her journey? Purposeless wanderer-style... made me think of when you enter a room and forget why you're there, but with lasers.

> Oh god and there was all this humming from the speakers - theatre has better surround sound than my living room obviously (forgot the sound system). Birt𝘏𝘋ay parties really, should have   surround sound machines to boost the 'happy birt𝘏𝘋ay' song's vibe. Yeah, my mind's skidding here...

Did I mention weird parallels with sunsets? Like, who knew they could merge with machinery and actually make you feel emotions like grinning like a raccoon? And then BANG, a scene happens and I lose the thread of what I'm even feeling. Oh crap, now I remember I have to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, become one with the chaos again, gotta understand.

Anyway, here's some random gibberish that accidentally got copied. 

```javascript
function randomThoughtGenerator(mindBlown) {
   if (mindBlown) {
      return What even is reality?;
   } else {
      return Back to popcorn.;
   }
}
let myBrain = randomThoughtGenerator(true);
```

I don’t even know, man. Keep it together. Mental note: don’t 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩  s jet-lagged.
